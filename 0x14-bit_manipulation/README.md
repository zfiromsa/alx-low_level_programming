##0x14. C - Bit manipulation
#Introduction#
Bit manipulation is the process of applying logical operations on a sequence of bits to achieve a required result. It is an act of algorithmically manipulating bits or other pieces of data shorter than a word.

Computer programming tasks that require bit manipulation include:

Low-level device control
Error detection and correction algorithms
Data compression
Encryption algorithms
Optimization
